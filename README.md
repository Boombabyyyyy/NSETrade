# NSETrade
a python program that fetches the latest stock price of a stock using the library NSETOOLS. The program asks for the scrip of the stock (e.g. TITAN) from the user as input and then prints its latest trading price at an interval of 5 seconds.

Instructions to run:
Once unzipped run the file in CMD or python IDE. Only packages imported/used are the NSETOOLS library and the time package in order to give current price every 5 seconds, there are no other complications in running this program.

Importing NSETOOLS:
pip install nsetools

NOTE: VScode and other IDEâ€™s sometimes throw an Import not resolved error when importing these packages which is an IDE issue, so if this occurs try setting the python interpreter again or after installing the packages run the program in Command prompt(CMD).
